Once solved at scale, it will change the world as we know it. The industry has made meaningful progress, but commercial deployment is still limited by traditional approaches that don’t take full advantage of the power of AI, and are technically cumbersome and costly to scale. AI is our single greatest key to unlocking self-driving. In this talk, I will discuss our breakthrough AI-first approach — bringing the promise of self-driving closer to commercialization than ever before.
